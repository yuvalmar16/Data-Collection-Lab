## Overview

In today's professional world, first impressions matter‚Äîand a LinkedIn profile picture plays a key role! As part of the **Data Collection Lab** at the Technion, we built a **LinkedIn Profile Image Evaluator** üèÜ

### üîπ What does it do?

Our app analyzes a profile image and provides:

‚úÖ A rating (1-100) based on key visual and professional factors  
‚úÖ Three personalized suggestions to enhance the picture  

The goal? Helping users make **data-driven choices** about their professional presence on LinkedIn!

### üîç Technologies Used:

üñ•Ô∏è **MediaPipe & dlib** ‚Äì Face detection & analysis  
ü§ñ **OpenAI CLIP** ‚Äì AI-powered image understanding  
üî• **PyTorch TabNet** ‚Äì Machine learning model training  
‚ö° **PySpark** ‚Äì Efficient large-scale data processing  
üì∑ **OpenCV** ‚Äì Image preprocessing

## Scraping Pictures

The **scraping notebook** uses the **Google Search API (SerpAPI)** to extract profile images from corporate websites. It automates retrieving image URLs by searching for professional profile pictures from company "Our Team" pages.

---

## Preprocessing Images

The image analysis pipeline was executed on **Azure Databricks**, using a notebook named **"PreProcess images and features"**, with data stored in `dbfs/FileStore`. 

### **Preprocessing Steps:**
- Unzipped multiple image archives and merged them into a single directory (`/dbfs/FileStore/all_images_combined`).
- Ensured no duplicates by renaming files with identical names.
- Labeled images with a **score (1-100)** and extracted **29 features** using CLIP.
- Saved the extracted features into a CSV file (`Profile_Pictures_extracted.csv`).

### **Feature Extraction Techniques:**
- **CLIP**: Analyzed images for professional attributes like smile, attire, background clarity, and trustworthiness.
- **MediaPipe**: Detected facial landmarks and body proportions, ensuring proper face positioning.
- **Dlib**: Analyzed nose and eye alignment for direct eye contact assessment.
- **OpenCV**: Evaluated **image resolution, lighting quality, and clarity**.

## Running the Train and Test Code

The **[Train and Test Notebook](https://github.com/yuvalmar16/Data-Collection-Lab/blob/main/Train%20and%20test%20(3).ipynb)** loads the extracted dataset (`Profile_pictures_extracted.csv`) and performs:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation matrix to identify key feature relationships.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model predicts LinkedIn scores from extracted image attributes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance assessed using **MSE, R¬≤, and feature importance analysis**.

This transforms raw image data into actionable insights and predictive analytics for profile evaluation.

## Download LinkedIn Score Predictor Weights

You can download the **pre-trained model weights** from:

üì• [linkedin_score_predictor.pth](https://github.com/yuvalmar16/Data-Collection-Lab/blob/main/linkedin_score_predictor.pth)

To use it in your notebook, save it in the **models** folder in `dbfs`, ensuring:
```python
input_dim = 28
```
‚úÖ Model loading is already included in the **train & test** notebook and the **app notebook**.

## Running The App

The **[LinkedIn Image Evaluator App](https://github.com/yuvalmar16/Data-Collection-Lab/blob/main/Linkedin_image_evaluator_App.ipynb)** allows real-time evaluation of LinkedIn profile pictures. You can run the evaluation using urls as input, or Alternatively add your own ngrok Authentication in the marked place to run the site.

### **App Features:**
- Users can **input image URLs** or **upload images** for scoring.
- The trained model **assesses key professional attributes** like expression, attire, background, and overall appeal.
- Offers a **web-based interactive experience** for improving profile images.

üöÄ Run the app and optimize your LinkedIn presence today! üî•
